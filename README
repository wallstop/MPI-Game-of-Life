This is the Game of Life program for OpenMPI wrought from the brains of Christopher Parish and Eli Pinkerton

The board is split into rectangular regions and distributed to the processes launched from the mpirun invocation.

The board definition is similar to the single threaded version as the number of processes wanted is now sent via the mpirun command.

Here, '*' represents a living cell, and '.' represents a dead one

to compile, call "mpicc MPI_Partition.c GeometrySplitter.c -std=c99"
and to run, call "mpirun -n 2 a.out TestBoard.txt" where TestBoard.txt is the board file and 2 is the number of processes requested
